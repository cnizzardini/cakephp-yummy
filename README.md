## Features

### [YummySearch](https://github.com/cnizzardini/cakephp-yummy/wiki/Yummy-Search)

A search component designed to work with CakePHPs Paginator Component and Cake\ORM\Query. It supports searching the 
base model and other associations such as HasOne, BelongsTo, and HasMany through an intuitive UI in just three easy steps.

```php
// Step 1. Basic Controller Usage:
$query = $this->ModelName->find();

$this->loadComponent('Yummy.YummySearch',['query' => query]);

$results = $this->paginate($this->YummySearch->search($query));

// Step 2. Basic View Usage:
$this->helpers()->load('Yummy.YummySearch');
echo $this->YummySearch->basicForm();

// Step 3. Include agnostic JavaScript
<script src="/yummy/js/yummy-search.js"></script>

// Define ACLs (you can also define ACLs in a single config file)
$this->YummyAcl->actions([
    'login' => '*', // allow all 
    'view' => ['Admin','Manager'], // allow Admin + Manager
