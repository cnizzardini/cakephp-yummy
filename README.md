Access Control List (ACL), a search component with an intuitive user-interface, 
and boostrap 3 Bake Themes. Each of these components may be used separately.

## Demo & Docs

[Live Demo available](https://cnizz.com/yummy-demo) and fully documented in the [git wiki](https://github.com/cnizzardini/cakephp-yummy/wiki).

## Features

### [YummySearch](https://github.com/cnizzardini/cakephp-yummy/wiki/Yummy-Search)

A search component designed to work with CakePHPs Paginator Component and Cake\ORM\Query. It supports searching the 
base model and other associations such as HasOne, BelongsTo, and HasMany through an intuitive UI in just three easy steps.

```php
// Step 1. Basic Controller Usage:
$query = $this->ModelName->find();

$this->loadComponent('Yummy.YummySearch',[
    'query' => $query,
    'allow' => [
        'Table.column' => ['name' => 'Column Name'],
    ]
]);

$results = $this->paginate($this->YummySearch->search($query));

// Step 2. Basic View Usage:
$this->helpers()->load('Yummy.YummySearch');
echo $this->YummySearch->basicForm();

// Step 3. Include agnostic JavaScript
<script src="/yummy/js/yummy-search.js"></script>
 
```

usage and customization. 

### [YummyAcl](https://github.com/cnizzardini/cakephp-yummy/wiki/Yummy-ACL)

A component that works with Auth to add group-based access controls to your admin portal.

$this->loadComponent('Yummy.YummyAcl',[
    'group' => $this->Auth->user('group'),
]);

// Define ACLs (you can also define ACLs in a single config file)
$this->YummyAcl->actions([
    'login' => '*', // allow all 
    'view' => ['Admin','Manager'], // allow Admin + Manager
    'edit' => ['Admin'], // allow Admin
]);
```
